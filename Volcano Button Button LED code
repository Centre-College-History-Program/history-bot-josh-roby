# John Harney, Centre College, updated 10.21.19

# this code exists thanks to Texas-Mark on the official RPi forums,
# he shared the code the original (PIR sensor) iteration of this was based on at
# https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=176241

# button code version relied heavily on Soren at
# https://raspberrypihq.com/use-a-push-button-with-raspberry-pi-gpio/

# this is the base code for all history bots as of 10.21.19
